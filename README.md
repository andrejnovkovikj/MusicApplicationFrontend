A simple website that serves as a demo of an application for music streaming service. The backend is made by using Spring Boot and the frontend is made by using React. Both the frontend and the backend are deployed on render,com for free. If the backend URL hasn’t been previously accessed, the Backend most probably is not online and the data won’t be fetched by the frontend. This is because of the limitations of a free render deployment. If the backend URL is accessed, or the login button on the Navigation bar is pressed, the backend service will start. Note: the loading of the backend might take some time, due to the limitations of the free render deployment.
